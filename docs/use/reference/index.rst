Reference
=========

Welcome to the reference section of the :ref:`user_guide` here you will find in
depth documentation on everything that comes with :code:`topos` currently this
section is split into two sections :ref:`use_ref_high` and :ref:`use_ref_low`.

The High Level reference is for all the tools and objects that are designed
with a specific task in mind e.g. create a cylinder.

Whereas the Low Level section is for all the tools and objects which are more
general purpose and form the foundation for everything in the High Level
section. These objects are very flexible and you can get very powerful results
using them however it may not be as straightforward to use.

.. _use_ref_high:

High Level
----------

Currently the high level section only consists of *primitives* these are simple
meshes which you can use as a starting point to build more complex objects
from.

Topos comes with the following primitives

.. hlist::

    - :ref:`use_ref_prim_cylinder`
    - :ref:`use_ref_prim_plane`

.. _use_ref_low:

Low Level
---------

.. hlist::

    - :ref:`use_ref_vertx_array`

.. toctree::
    :hidden:
    :maxdepth: 1

    cylinder
    plane
    vertexarray
