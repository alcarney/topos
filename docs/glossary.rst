    cartesian coordinate
        The mathematical name give to the standard :math:`(x, y, z)` coordinates
        in 3D space.

    cylindrical coordinate
        An alternate coordinate system for 3D space. Typically uses the
        coordinate labels :math:`(r, \theta, z)` where :math:`r` is the
        distance around the origin :math:`\theta` is the angle anticlockwise
        around from the line :math:`x = 0` and :math:`z` is the standard
        "height" coordinate you would find in the cartesian system.

    numpy array
        `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ is a Python package used heavily in
        the Academic and Data Science communities for manipulating array-like
        data structures such as matrices, images and astronomical data. Topos
        makes use of these arrays internally for manipulating and managing
        mesh data.

    vertex
        Forms part of a mesh, a collection of vertices define a face, a vertex
        for each corner. Mathematicians would typically refer to one as a point
        unless stated otherwise the terms points and vertices can be used
        interchangably.
