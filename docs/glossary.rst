    cartesian coordinate
        The mathematical name give to the standard :math:`(x, y, z)` coordinates
        in 3D space.

    cylindrical coordinate
        An alternate coordinate system for 3D space. Typically uses the
        coordinate labels :math:`(r, \theta, z)` where :math:`r` is the
        distance around the origin :math:`\theta` is the angle anticlockwise
        around from the line :math:`x = 0` and :math:`z` is the standard
        "height" coordinate you would find in the cartesian system.

    numpy array
        `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ is a Python package used heavily in
        the Academic and Data Science communities for manipulating array-like
        data structures such as matrices, images and astronomical data. Topos
        makes use of these arrays internally for manipulating and managing
        mesh data.

    pip
        `Pip <https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html>`_ is a Python
        tool that is used to install packages and their dependencies.

    REPL
        An abbreviation that stands for "Read Eval Print Loop". Many different
        programming languages have some form of REPL. It allows the user
        to run small snippets of code and immediately see the result. You can access
        Python's REPL by typing :code:`python` on the command line.

    vertex
        Forms part of a mesh, a collection of vertices define a face, a vertex
        for each corner. Mathematicians would typically refer to one as a point
        unless stated otherwise the terms points and vertices can be used
        interchangably.

    virtualenv
        Short for "virtual environment" a `virtualenv <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_
        essentially is an installation that is local to your project. Once
        activated all python commands will use the interpreter and packages
        that have been installed into it. They allow you to have many versions
        of libraries installed on your machine without them interfering with
        each other.
